  <h1>
    My name is Ian Pous
  </h1>
  <main>
    My favorite school subject is science.
    <ul>
      Science is my favorite subject because I like learning about new things,
      and I think logically rather than creatively.
    </ul>
    My favorite book is Unbroken
    <ul>
      I enjoy Unbroken because it's a good story, and it shows how much you can
      do as long as you stay mentaly strong and don't let anything break you
      down.
    </ul>
    My favorite movie is Robin Hoot directed by Ridley Scott
    <ul>
      Robin Hood is my favorite movie because it's the best retelling of the
      legend of Robin Hood in my opinion, and it captures how corrupt Prince
      John is.
    </ul>
